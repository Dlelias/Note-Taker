## Description
The Note Taker application can be used to create, save, and delete notes.

### Motivation
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Installation
The app required npm install for express and uuvid4. Nodemon was also used for testing the server connection, but it is completely optional. 

## Usage 
Once the application is connected to the server the homepage will display

__The left column will contain the notes list. If there are note saved " no save notes " will be displayed 
__The right column is the note body. The user will title and write their list here. Please note both the title and the body text must be completed before a note can be saved
